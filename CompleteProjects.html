              <p>Apr 2024 - May 2024</p>
              <p>Developed for Expercis, this plugin was made to help manage job submissions and send emails to all those who want to be part of the mailing list. It was made as a WordPress Plugin using PHP and SendGrid.</p>

              <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
              <p>I first began designing this website on 12/29/23. I made it to serve as a centralized location where I can go into detail about my skillset and projects I have completed outside of school. Initially, it was just going to be a single web page, but quickly expanded into multiple when the one webpage started getting too long. I first started putting it on my resume on 2/18/24. Of course, this project will never be ‘completed’ since I plan to continue maintaining and updating it throughout my career.</p>
              <p>Like most websites, it was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GitHub pages to host my website. It is a free resource that was more than enough for what I needed. At first, I was simply developing it directly from the repository. However, I discovered early on that the CSS takes a long time to update when developing like this. To solve this problem, I cloned the repository into VSCode so I can develop it locally on my computer. Using the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey, I was able to see the changes I am making as soon as I save them, significantly speeding up the process.</p>
              <p>Over all, I am very happy with how this website is turning out and will be excited to watch it grow alongside me.</p>

              <h2>Maps - Ogallala Commons</h2>
              <p>In the summer of 2023, I embedded two maps into websites for Ogallala Commons.</p>
              <p>The markers themselves were designed in Illustrator. I made several concept designs and my mentors felt that the designs made to look like physical pins were the best choice. Here is the first concept of that marker:</p>
              <img src="https://github.com/Darrian-Lambert/Darrian-Lambert.github.io/blob/main/pin4.png?raw=true" alt="Concept Pin Marker" class="OCMapIMG">
              <p>I designed the application in VSCode using Google Maps API to give users an up to date dynamic map. The first map was embedded into <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. It shows all internships managed by OC since 2007 as well as what each intern did. It is used as a complementary tool to show potential interns and partners the volume of work OC has done over the years through the internship program. The other map was embedded into <a href = "https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. It is another searchable map that shows producers and what they produce. It is used to help users find producers who produce the product they are looking for.</p>

              <p>To update these maps after I’m gone, I created a map updater to help OC update the map without needing to write the JavaScript. It’s a simple program that runs on the user’s browser. Users input the changes they want to make then input the generated list into the website. Since this application was only for internal usage, there are no publically viewable versions of the application for security purposes.</p>
