              <h2>Maps - Ogallala Commons</h2>
              <p>In the summer of 2023, I embedded two maps into websites for Ogallala Commons.</p>
              <p>The markers themselves were designed in Illustrator. I made several concept designs and my mentors felt that the designs made to look like physical pins were the best choice. Here is the first concept of that marker:</p>
              <img src="https://github.com/Darrian-Lambert/Darrian-Lambert.github.io/blob/main/pin4.png?raw=true" alt="Concept Pin Marker" class="OCMapIMG">
              <p>I designed the application in VSCode using Google Maps API to give users an up to date dynamic map. The first map was embedded into <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. It shows all internships managed by OC since 2007 as well as what each intern did. It is used as a complementary tool to show potential interns and partners the volume of work OC has done over the years through the internship program. The other map was embedded into <a href = "https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. It is another searchable map that shows producers and what they produce. It is used to help users find producers who produce the product they are looking for.</p>

              <img src="https://github.com/Darrian-Lambert/Darrian-Lambert.github.io/blob/main/FS_IMG.png?raw=true" alt="Producer Map" class="OCMapIMG">
              <p>To update these maps after I’m gone, I created a map updater to help OC update the map without needing to write the JavaScript. It’s a simple program that runs on the user’s browser. Users input the changes they want to make then input the generated list into the website. Since this application was only for internal usage, there are no publically viewable versions of the application for security purposes.</p>
