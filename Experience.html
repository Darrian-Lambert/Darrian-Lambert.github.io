              <p class="WTime">February 2024 - Current</p>
              <p>Working to update the Course Management System from a PHP web framework to a JavaScript Framework. Throughout this project, I have:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Worked to create a detailed UML to plan and explain the program</li>
                <li>Created the first prototype using a MySQL database, Node.js, Express.js, Fetch API, and a standard front-end format with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for quicker development</li>
                <li>Developed the second prototype with a React Framework for the front end and connected it to the back-end of the first prototype</li>
                <li>Continued making updates to improve the system's efficiency and to better fit the needs of its users</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The system allows users to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create assessment plans for each section each year</li>
                <li>Manage FCARs for each course</li>

                <li>All users can manage their own accounts</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additional functionalities of the application:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For security purposes, users are signed in for only 6 hours</li>
                <li>All components have error and loading states for better performance</li>
                <li>Dropdowns are searchable to help find specific content more easily, especially when dealing with a large number of options</li>

              <h3>Intern</h3>
              <p class="WTime">June 2024 - September 2024</p>
              <p>I was hired on as a Database Intern, but the internship primarily focused on fixing back-end problems and integrating OC operations into Zoho. During my time in this internship, I:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed several issues with their notification system to ensure information accuracy, directed notifications to the appropriate recipients, and eliminated redundant notifications</li>
                <li>Updated forms to automatically transfer information into ZohoDrive, eliminating the need for manual data entry</li>
                <li>Updated their system to handle a three-stipend layout (it previously only supported two for Level 1 interns)</li>
                <li>Fixed the Monday report to show which interns needed to be paid</li>
                <li>Implemented a memory management system in Zoho CRM, where documents stored in CRM are automatically moved to Zoho WorkDrive after a set period to optimize storage in CRM</li>
                <li>Reduced the cost of Zoho by tailoring the plan to fit OCâ€™s actual needs</li>
                <li>Began integrating the employee system into Zoho CRM, allowing employees to sign in and access documents. Employees were given the ability to send reimbursement forms and view their documents before the internship ended</li>
                <li>Enabled employees with access to fill out the accounting form for the weekly accounting log</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Overall, this internship has provided valuable experience with Zoho integration and optimizing operational workflows.</p>

              <h3>Web Developer Intern</h3>
              <p class="WTime">June 2023 - August 2023</p>
              <p>In the summer of 2023, I did an internship for Ogallala Commons. For them, I embedded two maps onto their websites. The first one is a map that displays all the interns OC has managed since 2007. It works to show interns, family of interns, and organizations how OC has grown over the years. It can be accessed at <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. The other map I made shows producers that work with Ogallala Commons via Foodshed. This map can help people find specific products among the various producers that work with this program. It can be accessed at <a href="https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. To help update these maps without needing to know JavaScript, I also made a simple browser application that OC administrative staff can use. Throughout this internship, I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on VSCode. I worked with GoogleMapsAPI so that users can have an accurate map to work with. The websites I embedded the maps on worked with WordPress.</p>

              <h3>Assistant Produce Manager</h3>
              <p class="WTime">January 2018 - May 2023</p>
              <p>This was my first job. I started as a sacker and eventually became an Assistant Produce Manager after a few years. While there, I helped manage a team of 22 people. I made the schedules, helped train team members, helped to resolve occasional conflicts, led the department when the produce manager was out, performed performance evaluations, helped guests, and other things of this nature. I enjoyed working with the team. I ended my employment in May of 2023 to pursue opportunities to gain work experience relevant to the career I hope to pursue.</p>
