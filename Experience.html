              <h3>Intern</h3>
              <p class="WTime">June 2024 - Current</p>
              <p>I was hired on as a Database Intern, but this internship is primarily focused on fixing back-end problems and integrating OC Operations into Zoho. At the time of writing this, I've fixed several problems with their notification system as far as making sure the information on there is correct, making sure the notifications are going to the right people, and got rid of redundant notifications.</p>
              <p>I've also updated their forms to automatically move information into the Zohodrive so that it no longer needs to be done manually.</p>
              <p>While I'm still early on in the internship, I plan to do much more in the time I have this summer.</p>

              <p class="WTime">February 2024 - Current</p>
              <p>I was hired for Expercis to help the website grow. In my time with Expercis, I've added many jobs to the job page, worked on the SEO for the website including improving performance and integrating keywords into all of the pages, and created a wordpress plugin that allows users to submit jobs for the job page, allows Expercis to manage the submitted jobs, and allows expercis to easily contanct all those interested in recieving emails. The plugin was created using PHP and uses SendGrid for sending the email notifications.  Since I've began working on the SEO, Expercis has seen a significant growth in traffic on the website, I'll work to continue this trend upwards.</p>

              <p class="WTime">February 2024 - Current</p>
              <p>Working to update Course Management System from a PHP web framework to a JavaScript Framework. During this project, I designed the UML diagrams for this project. These diagrams facilitated effective communication among team members, ensuring everyone had a clear understanding of the project scope and functionality. I've built the first prototype for this project. Since I wanted to finish it quickly, I built the first one with a basic format for the front end using these technologies for the project:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Database:</li>
                <ul><li>MySQL</li></ul>
                <li>Back-end:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Node.js</li>
                  <li>Express.js</li>
                  <li>Fetch API</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Front-end:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>JavaScript</li>
                  <li>CSS</li>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>Once that was complete, I began development of the second build of the project using a React Framework. As of now, the second prototype is nearly complete!</p>

              <h2>Ogallala Commons</h2>
              <h3>Web Developer Intern</h3>
              <p class="WTime">June 2023 - August 2023</p>
              <p>In the summer of 2023, I did an internship for Ogallala Commons. For them, I embedded two maps onto their websites. The first one is a map that displays all the interns OC has managed since 2007. It works to show interns, family of interns, and organizations how OC has grown over the years. It can be accessed at <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. The other map I made shows producers that work with Ogallala Commons via Foodshed. This map can help people find specific products among the various producers that work with this program. It can be accessed at <a href="https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. To help update these maps without needing to know JavaScript, I also made a simple browser application that OC administrative staff can use. Throughout this internship, I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on VSCode. I worked with GoogleMapsAPI so that users can have an accurate map to work with. The websites I embedded the maps on worked with WordPress.</p>

              <h3>Assistant Produce Manager</h3>
              <p class="WTime">January 2018 - May 2023</p>
              <p>This was my first job. I started as a sacker and eventually became an Assistant Produce Manager after a few years. While there, I helped manage a team of 22 people. I made the schedules, helped train team members, helped to resolve occasional conflicts, led the department when the produce manager was out, performed performance evaluations, helped guests, and other things of this nature. I enjoyed working with the team. I ended my employment in May of 2023 to pursue opportunities to gain work experience relevant to the career I hope to pursue.</p>
