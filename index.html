          Hello! My name is Darrian Lambert and this is my portfolio website! I am currently working towards my bachelor’s degree in computer information systems. At the time of writing this, most of my experience is geared towards web development. I am open to learning other similar skills in the near future. This portfolio will show projects I’ve worked on as well as skills I’ve developed over the years. Thank you for taking the time to look through this page!

        <h3>Ogallala Commons</h3>
        <h4>Web Developer Intern</h4>
        <p>June 2023 - August 2023</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2023, I did an internship for Ogallala Commons. For them, I embedded two maps onto their websites. The first one is a map that displays all the interns OC has managed since 2007. It works to show interns, family of interns, and organizations how OC has grown over the years. It can be accessed at https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/. The other map I made shows producers that work with Ogallala Commons via Foodshed. This map can help people find specific products among the various producers that work with this program. It can be accessed at https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/. To help update these maps without needing to know JavaScript, I also made a simple browser application that OC administrative staff can use. Throughout this internship, I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on VSCode. I worked with GoogleMapsAPI so that users can have an accurate map to work with. The websites I embedded the maps on worked with WordPress.</p>

        <h4>Assistant Produce Manager</h4>
        <p>January 2018 - May 2023</p>
        <p>This was my first job. I started as a sacker and eventually became an Assistant Produce Manager after a few years. While there, I helped manage a team of 22 people. I made the schedules, helped train team members, helped to resolve occasional conflicts, led the department when the produce manager was out, performed performance evaluations, helped guests, and other things of this nature. I enjoyed working with the team. I ended my employment in May of 2023 to pursue opportunities to gain work experience relevant to the career I hope to pursue.</p>
