          Hello! My name is Darrian Lambert and this is my portfolio website! I am currently working towards my bachelor’s degree in computer information systems. At the time of writing this, most of my experience is geared towards web development. I am open to learning other similar skills in the near future. This portfolio will show projects I’ve worked on as well as skills I’ve developed over the years. Thank you for taking the time to look through this page!

        <h3>Maps - Ogallala Commons</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2023, I embedded two maps into websites for Ogallala Commons.</p>
        <p>The markers themselves were designed in Illustrator. I made several designs and my mentors felt that the designs made to look like physical pins were the best choice.</p>
        <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E2DAQExaQ-CMV-y0Q/profile-treasury-image-shrink_800_800/0/1700153926238?e=1706043600&v=beta&t=71MSQBkHCprjf8ZUcO_HKs540I8sb5l4se56kZ5mdCA" alt="Concept Pin Marker" class="OCMapIMG">
        <p>I designed the application on VSCode using Google Maps API to give users an up to date dynamic map. The first map was embedded into <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. It shows all internships managed by OC since 2007 as well as what each intern did. It is used as a complementary tool to show potential interns and partners the volume of work OC has done over the years through the internship program. The other map was embedded into <a href = "https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. It is another searchable map that shows producers and what they produce. It is used to help users find producers who produce the product they are looking for.</p>

        <p>To update these maps after I’m gone, I created a map updater to help OC update the map without needing to write the JavaScript. It’s a simple program that runs on the user’s browser. You input the changes you want to make then input the generated list into the website.</p>

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <div class="WEX">
        <h3>Ogallala Commons</h3>
        <h4>Web Developer Intern</h4>
        <p class="WTime">June 2023 - August 2023</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2023, I did an internship for Ogallala Commons. For them, I embedded two maps onto their websites. The first one is a map that displays all the interns OC has managed since 2007. It works to show interns, family of interns, and organizations how OC has grown over the years. It can be accessed at <a href="https://ogallalacommons.org/intern-map/" target="_blank">ogallalacommons.org</a>. The other map I made shows producers that work with Ogallala Commons via Foodshed. This map can help people find specific products among the various producers that work with this program. It can be accessed at <a href="https://myfoodshed.org/producer-map/" target="_blank">myfoodshed.org</a>. To help update these maps without needing to know JavaScript, I also made a simple browser application that OC administrative staff can use. Throughout this internship, I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on VSCode. I worked with GoogleMapsAPI so that users can have an accurate map to work with. The websites I embedded the maps on worked with WordPress.</p>

        <h3>United Supermarkets</h3>
        <h4>Assistant Produce Manager</h4>
        <p class="WTime">January 2018 - May 2023</p>
        <p>This was my first job. I started as a sacker and eventually became an Assistant Produce Manager after a few years. While there, I helped manage a team of 22 people. I made the schedules, helped train team members, helped to resolve occasional conflicts, led the department when the produce manager was out, performed performance evaluations, helped guests, and other things of this nature. I enjoyed working with the team. I ended my employment in May of 2023 to pursue opportunities to gain work experience relevant to the career I hope to pursue.</p>
