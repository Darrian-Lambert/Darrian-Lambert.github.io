              <h2>PARS Upgrade Project - WT</h2>
              <p>Working to update Course Management System from a PHP web framework to JavaScript Framework.</p>
              <p>From the time I started this position, I've:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Worked to create a detailed UML to plan and explain the program</li>
                <li>Created the first prototype using:
                  <ul>
                    <li>a MySQL database</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                    <li>Express.js</li>
                    <li>Fetch API</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Created the second prototype with a React Framework for the front end and connected it to the back-end of the first prototype</li>
                <li>Continued making updates to improve efficiency and better meet the needs of users</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>I built this project on my own, but users are able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create assessment plans for each section each year</li>
                <li>Manage FCARs for each course</li>
                <li>View reports to track progress towards meeting student outcome goals</li>
                <li>Review assessment plans to see how well course learning objectives are met overall</li>
                <li>Admins can manage years, courses, sections, users, student outcome goals, course learning objectives, and measurement methods</li>
                <li>All users can manage their own account</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>Additional functionalities of the application:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For security purposes, users are signed in for only 6 hours</li>
                <li>All components have error and loading states for better performance</li>
                <li>Dropdowns are searchable to easily find content when dealing with many options</li>
                <li>Strong responsive design setup for various screen sizes</li>
              </ul>
            
              <p>This project has been a great learning experience and is the largest application I've built on my own at this point in my career.</p>

              <h2>Community Link</h2>
              <p>In the Bufftechs group, we are developing an open-source application meant to help nonprofits with operations. This application is designed to assist in managing donations and organizational information.</p>
              
              <p>In this project I:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Designed some of the UMLs for the project</li>
                <li>During a two-month absence of our leader due to an emergency, I co-led the group's operations with another team member, scheduling meetings, establishing the GitHub Repository, and managing communications to keep everyone aligned</li>
                <li>Setup the project using ASP.Net Core and connected it to a MySQL Database</li>
                <li>Worked with the group to distribute tasks and develop the application</li>
                <li>Implemented the ability for users to sign in and manage their own accounts</li>
                <li>Created functionality allowing users to donate to requests</li>
                <li>Implemented the cookie and session logic, allowing users to remain signed in for 7 days while supporting session sign-ins for those blocking cookies</li>
                <li>Set up most of the employee and admin actions, from user management to inventory management</li>
                <li>Implemented an internal messaging system for employees and admins</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>This project has been a great experience, providing me with the opportunity to develop an application with a team, offering valuable practice with version control and communication.</p>

              <h2>Expercis Job Submission and Email Plugin</h2>
              <p>Developed for Expercis, this plugin was created to help manage job submissions and send emails to all those who want to be part of the mailing list. It was built as a WordPress Plugin using PHP and SendGrid.</p>
              
              <p>In recent months, I began further development, expanding its functionality to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Connect to WooCommerce and WP Job Openings to manage the purchasing of premium job positions</li>
                <li>Help users track the performance of their job submissions</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>This project provided me with the opportunity to develop a robust WordPress plugin and expand its features over time based on client needs.</p>
